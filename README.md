# NBA Salary Predictions

## Introduction
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men’s professional basketball league comprised of 30 teams.  Each of these teams have multi-million dollar budgets that they use in order to build a talented team that will hopefully win enough games to bring home the NBA title.  To do this, the teams build their rosters based on talent and budget.  While team payrolls are large, they are not unlimited and strategic decisions must be made to develop the most talented team while maintaining budget constraints.  The assumption of most teams, and players as well, is that the more money a particular player demands, the better the player.  This is not always the case, however.  There are numerous instances where players have been drastically overpaid and dramatically underperformed. Conversely, there have been players that have performed well above their higher-paid counter-parts.  Ideally, there would be a mechanism where player salary could be determined by consistent player performance.  It is reasonable to assume that NBA front offices do indeed subscribe to this premise, but some player salaries would suggest otherwise.  The purpose behind this project is to use predictive analytics to predict what a player’s salary should be by looking at player statistics.

## Data Sources Used
This project uses the NBA player statistics dataset that was obtained from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/koki25ando/salary).  The website lists the statistics as originating from 2017-2018 team rosters, but upon further verification, the rosters are more in line with 2016-2017 data.  The downloaded data contained 88 missing salary values.  All but two of these were obtained from the [HoopsHype.com](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2016-2017/) website of player salaries.
